# Chocopy-to-Javascript-translator
## Chocopy to Javascript translator using ANTLR

Project for the Programming languages class at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

### Use instructions

There are three ways of using this translator:
- **Execute with program arguments:** Configure as program argument the file path of the code you want to translate.
For example Input/program.txt
- **Run code on the console:** Run the program without arguments, a set of instructions will appear. Press 0
- **Put name of file on the console:** Run the program without arguments, a set of instructions will appear. Press 1

Translated code to javascript will be shown in console, as well as any errors that the source code might have.\
Translated code will also be written in the Translate folder, inside a file named translate.js. This code can be
 executed with node.js
